# ubuntu_windows_dual_boot_info

This repository is merely to provide information on how I am setting up my laptop for dual-booting.

I am dual-booting mainly because while I can run most things no problem within a virtual machine, that approach can prove tricky for addressing certain hardware components from whichever OS resides within the VM. I need Microsoft products for some of my academic work, but I need Linux for programming and most of my data analysis.

A prerequisite for my move toward a dual boot was that I can utilize the same storage partition from either OS. This way I can for instance, listen to my music collection regardless of which OS I am currently working from. Also, if I generate some data on the Linux side, then I would be able to view it from the Windows side while working on a manuscript.

I am using information from [this article on making the two OS's cooperate.](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/35807/how-to-harmonize-your-dual-boot-setup-for-windows-and-ubuntu/)

That article doesn't focus enough on the paritioning scheme so I will provide more detail as I work. [Full installation details are available at the wiki page.](https://github.com/alk224/ubuntu_windows_dual_boot_info/wiki)
